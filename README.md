# Fit Glyph Cells
A RoboFont [start-up script](https://robofont.com/documentation/how-tos/setting-up-a-startup-script/) that places a button to the left of the glyph cell size slider (below Font Overview). This button, when pressed, sizes the glyph cells and the Font Overview window such that they’re as large as possible, while all being shown.

### Known issues:

* In Single Window Mode, panel resize does not fit perfectly on first button press.
* If you have open fonts and change your SWM preference, you may experience weird window/panel behavior unless you restart.
